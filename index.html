      <h2>Hey There!</h2>
      <h3> Welcome to my Website</h3>
      <p>
          I'm Aliza, a student developer with a strong interest in software systems, automation, and building projects that solve real-world problems. I enjoy working across both hardware and software, from Arduino-based systems to full web applications, and I’m especially interested in testing, debugging, and improving system reliability. I’ve led coding clubs, participated in hackathons, and I’m always looking to learn new technologies and take on meaningful challenges.
